# C++ Pathfinding
This is a quick learning project, capable of generating a random obstacle or terrain, in an 2D simulation, and finding a suitable path, using my own implementation.

I named the algorithm, PheromoneAlgorithm, after the inspiration of a feature from ants, where it will avoid previously treadded tiles.
